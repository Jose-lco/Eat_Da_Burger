AS a restaurant owner I would like when a customer decides to eat at my restaurant, or when an employee takes an order for a burger they are able to keep track of orders in the restaurant which makes it better for them hence I created a burger app that facilitates this process.

## Usage

This is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
